<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>
I am a master student with <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sinisa/">Sinisa Todorovic</a> and <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/">Tom Dietterich</a> at Oregon State University. I was a member at Computer Vision Center of Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona from 2011 to 2012, where I took the <a href="http://mcvai.uab.cat/">MSc in computer vision and artificial intelligence</a>. In a time long gone, I obtained my BE at Hangzhou Dianzi University. 
</p>
<p>
I have been focusing on probabilistic graphical models and structured prediction for more than 2 years. I began my research with part-based object recognition problems. Now I spend more time on theoretical research of structured output learning, probabilistic inference and latent variable models. Specifically, my current research lie in 2 topics: a) latent structure models and b) structured output learning with decomposition.
</p>
<p>
I am particularly interested in neuroscience. I believe the mathematical models will finally help us to understand the human brain. An interesting idea is to parameterize the functionality of human brain, which would possibly rely on what we are doing in structured output learning. The idea of parameterization could have huge impact on human society. For example, we might be able to copy the personality of a human by learning a model based on behavior samples.
