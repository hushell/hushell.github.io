<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>
I am a PhD student at ENPC ParisTech, supervised by <a href="http://imagine.enpc.fr/~komodakn/">Nikos Komodakis</a> and <a href="http://imagine.enpc.fr/~obozinsg/">Guillaume Obozinski</a>. I got my MS in computer science at Oregon State University in March 2015. Before that, I took the MS courses in computer vision and artificial intelligence at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona from 2011 to 2012. In a time long gone, I obtained my BE at Hangzhou Dianzi University in 2010. 
</p>
<p>
My current research interests focus on probabilistic graphical models, optimizations and computer vision. I do believe the research in machine learning and computational neuroscience will eventually help us to understand the human brain. One of my ultimate goals is to parameterize the functionality of human brains, which would possibly rely on what we are doing in machine learning. Imagine what if we could characterize the personality of someone by learning computational models based on his/her behavior samples.
